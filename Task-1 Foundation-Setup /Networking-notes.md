Networking Basics

OSI Model

The OSI model has seven layers that explain how data moves across a network. Each layer has a specific function.

TCP/IP

TCP ensures reliable communication.
IP handles addressing and routing.

DNS

DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.

HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP is used for communication between browser and server.
HTTPS is secure because it uses encryption.

IP Addressing and NAT

IP addresses identify devices in a network.
NAT allows private networks to connect to the internet securely.
